SPNs located in the thoracic region (tSPNs) of the paravertebral sympathetic chain ganglia control vasomotor function to regulate vasculature in upper and middle extremities [1-2], and dysfunction of tSPNs is implicated in various autonomic disorders such as autonomic dysreflexia [3]. tSPNs are difficult to access <i>in vivo</i> study due to the adherent fat surrounding them, so their cellular properties are often inferred from SPNs located in the cervical and lumbar regions [4-8]. There are only 3 <i>in vitro</i> studies of the electrophysiological properties of tSPN in the vertebrate system [9-11], and they all employed a sharp microelectrode recording approach. However, recent studies show that sharp microelectrode recordings introduce electrode impalement-induced leak conductance, rendering less accurate recordings [6,11]. Dr. Shawn Hochmanâ€™s lab at Emory pioneers <i>whole-cell patch clamp recordings</i> of tSPN in mice <i>ex vivo</i>, which enables a more reliable examination of the cellular properties of tSPNs.    </div><div></div><div>                tSPNs are innervated by sympathetic preganglionic neurons located in the spinal cord, yet the connectivity pattern and recruitment principle between sympathetic preganglionic neurons and tSPNs are still unknown. One of the possible mechanisms of the functional connectivity pattern is the n+1 rule, which states that each postganglionic neuron receives one strong and suprathreshold input from the nearest preganglionic neuron, and several weak and subthreshold inputs from other preganglionic neurons. This rule was observed in the superior cervical and lumbar SPNs [5,12-13], and therefore                     was assumed to dominate the synaptic recruitment at tSPNs, which leads to the conventional view of tSPNs as 1:1 relays that pass the motor commands from the strongest preganglionic synaptic inputs down to regulate vasculature. However, a recent study shows that, without the electrode impalement-induced leak conductance, the average synaptic gain at rat sympathetic neurons is 2.4-fold [6]. This finding challenges the assumed 1:1 relay function of tSPNs and suggests that tSPNs amplify instead of relaying the strongest preganglionic synaptic inputs. Another possible mechanism is the size principle that has been observed in motoneurons and in sympathetic postganglionics in human lumbar ganglia: motoneurons with slower conduction velocity are recruited before those with faster values [14-16].    </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="846656" class="ltx_title_section">Materials and Methods</h1><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="239416" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="924408" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="855626" class="ltx_title_section">Acknowledgements</h1><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="888944" class="ltx_title_section">Sources</h1><ol><li>CMBC Pilot Fund</li><li>CRCNS 2015</li><li>R01 2016</li></ol><div></div>
